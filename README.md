# CRUD-operation-localStorage

Hi friends, Anand here

In this repositry you see many modern javascript feature such as let, const keywords, map() method, arrow or lamda funtion etc.

I use open-close principle of programming for doing CRUD operation on web strorage data.

You can find reusibility of methods for getting the values from form and reseting the form fields also.

Feel free to reach out me through my Email : mksaarya@gmail.com if you find any dificulties in code.
